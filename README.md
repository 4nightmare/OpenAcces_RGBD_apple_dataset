# OpenAcces_RGBD_apple_dataset
 Intel realsense d435i open access dataset of seasonal growth of fuji apple. 
 The dataset contains images and reference caliper ground truth data.
 Data were collected during 2022 season in a 3 years old apple orchard trained as 'Planar Cordon' (bidimensional training system).
 12 fruit on two trees (24 fruit in total) were monitored for their fruit size along the whole season.
 RGB-D pictures, manually labelled for the monitored fruit, were taken on 17 dates from a fruit size of  40mm approx. to >80mm approx
